The files list_filenames_mc and list_filenames_bq contain the links to the files of Dr Mallachs instance library.
They are just a convenient tool to download the instance graphs in the mc and bq format respectively.
As the library is divided into different sections one can find the section by searching the file for it, the instances of a section are listed blockwise.
