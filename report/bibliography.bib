abstract="In the previous chapters of Part II of this book we have shown how linear programs provide a systematic way of placing a good lower bound on OPT (assuming a minimization problem), for numerous NP-hard problems. As stated earlier, this is a key step in the design of an approximation algorithm for an NP-hard problem. It is natural, then, to ask if there are other widely applicable ways of doing this.",

abstract = {In 1983 Barahona defined the class of cut polytopes; recently Padberg defined the class of Boolean quadric polytopes. We show that every Boolean quadric polytope is the image of a cut polytope under a bijective linear transformation, and so studying Boolean quadric polytopes reduces to studying special cut polytopes. Our proof uses an idea introduced in 1965 by Hammer.}

    abstract = { The Goemans--Williamson randomized algorithm guarantees a high-quality approximation to the MAX-CUT problem, but the cost associated with such an approximation can be excessively high for large-scale problems due to the need for solving an expensive semidefinite relaxation. In order to achieve better practical performance, we propose an alternative, rank-two relaxation and develop a specialized version of the Goemans--Williamson technique. The proposed approach leads to continuous optimization heuristics applicable to MAX-CUT as well as other binary quadratic programs, for example the MAX-BISECTION problem.A computer code based on the rank-two relaxation heuristics is compared with two state-of-the-art semidefinite programming codes that implement the Goemans--Williamson randomized algorithm, as well as with a purely heuristic code for effectively solving a particular MAX-CUT problem arising in physics. Computational results show that the proposed approach is fast and scalable and, more importantly, attains a higher approximation quality in practice than that of the Goemans--Williamson randomized algorithm. An extension to MAX-BISECTION is also discussed, as is an important difference between the proposed approach and the Goemans--Williamson algorithm; namely, that the new approach does not guarantee an upper bound on the MAX-CUT optimal value. }

abstract = {It is widely believed that showing a problem to be NP-complete is tantamount to proving its computational intractability. In this paper we show that a number of NP-complete problems remain NP-complete even when their domains are substantially restricted. First we show the completeness of SIMPLE MAX CUT (MAX CUT with edge weights restricted to value 1), and, as a corollary, the completeness of the OPTIMAL LINEAR ARRANGEMENT problem. We then show that even if the domains of the NODE COVER and DIRECTED HAMILTONIAN PATH problems are restricted to planar graphs, the two problems remain NP-complete, and that these and other graph problems remain NP-complete even when their domains are restricted to graphs with low node degrees. For GRAPH 3-COLORABILITY, NODE COVER, and UNDIRECTED HAMILTONIAN CIRCUIT, we determine essentially the lowest possible upper bounds on node degree for which the problems remain NP-complete.},
